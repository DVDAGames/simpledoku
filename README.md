# simpledoku

**This project is still under construction and is in need of some fixes and some serious refactoring.**

`simpledoku` is a basic, desktop SuDoKu game built with React, Electron, Babel, and Webpack.

It's mostly just an exploration of React and Electron, but the concepts learned while building a Sudoku solver and puzzle generator were also valuable.
